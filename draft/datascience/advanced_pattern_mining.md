# Advanced pattern Mining

## Pattern Mining: A Road Map

**frequent pattern** is a pattern (or itemset) that satisfies a minimum support
threshold. A pattern p is a **closed pattern** if there is no superpattern p0 with the
same support as p. Pattern p is a **max-pattern** if there exists no frequent superpattern
of p. Frequent patterns can also be mapped into **association rules**, or other kinds
of rules based on interestingness measures. Sometimes we may also be interested in
**infrequent** or **rare patterns** (i.e., patterns that occur rarely but are of critical importance,
or **negative patterns** (i.e., patterns that reveal a negative correlation between
items).
