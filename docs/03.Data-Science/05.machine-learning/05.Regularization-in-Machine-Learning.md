# Regularization in ML

A central problem in machine learning is how to make an algorithm that will perform well not just on the training data, but also on new inputs.  Many strategies used in machine learning are explicitly designed to reduce the test error, possibly at the expense of increased training error. These strategies are known collectively as regularization. **Regularization is any modiÔ¨Åcation we make to a learning algorithm that is intended to reduce its generalization error but not its training error.**
