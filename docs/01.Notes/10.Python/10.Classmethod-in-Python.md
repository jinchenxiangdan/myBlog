# Classmethod in Python

The **classmethod()** is an inbuilt function in Python, which returns a class method for a given function.

``` py
# fun: the function that needs to be convert into a class method
# return: a class method for function
@classmethod
def fun(cls, arg1, arg2, ...):
	"""
	cls: class
	"""
```

## Class method vs. Static Method

- A class method takes `cls` as the first parameter while a static method needs no specific parameters.
- A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method canâ€™t access or modify it.
- In general, static methods know nothing about the class state. They are utility-type methods that take some parameters and work upon those parameters. On the other hand class methods must have class as a parameter.
- We use @classmethod decorator in python to create a class method and we use @staticmethod decorator to create a static method in python.
