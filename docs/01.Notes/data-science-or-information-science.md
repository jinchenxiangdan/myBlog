# Data or Information

## Difference between data and information

**Data** are raw facts.

**Information** is the result of processing raw data to reveal its meaning.

Data are the foundation of information, which is the bedrock of knowledge. Knowledge imples familiarity, awareness, and understanding of inoformation as it applies to an environment. A key characteristic of knowledge is that "new" knowledge can be derived from "old" knowledge.

## importance of database design

A database is a shared, integrated computer structure that stores a collection of:
    - End-user data (raw facts of interest to the end user)
    - Metadata (data about data)

A database management system (DBMS) is a collection of programs that manages the database structure and controls access to the data stored in the database. A DBMS provieds advantages such as:
    - Improved data sharing
    - Improved data security
    - Better data integration
    - Minimized data inconsistency (Data inconsistency exists when different versions of the same data appear in different places.)
    - Improved data access
    - Improved decision making
    - Increased end-user productivity

### Types if Database

- Single-user database
- Multiuser database
- Desktop database
- Workgroup database
- Enterprise database
- General-purpose database
- Discipline-specific database
- etc.
