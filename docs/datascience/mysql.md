## Mac

First, we need to install MySQL. On Mac, we could use [brew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) to install mysql. What you need to do is just open terminal and type `brew install mysql`.

After that, you need to type `mysql.server start` to start sql server.

## Linux

For different version of Linux, you can use the built in pakage manager to install and update MySQL.
