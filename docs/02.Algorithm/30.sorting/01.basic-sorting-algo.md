## Sorting Algorithms 
| Sorting Algorithm | Time Complex(Average) | Space Complex | isStable | isComplex |
|:-----------------:|-----------------------|---------------|----------|-----------|
| Insertion Sort    | O(n^2)                | O(1)          | Stable   | Simple    |
| Shell Sort        | O(n^1.3)              | O(1)          | Unstable | Complex   |
| Bubble Sort       | O(n^2)                | O(1)          | Stable   | Simple    |
| Quick Sort        | O(nlog2(n)ï¼‰          | O(log2(n))    | Unstable | Complex   |
| Selection Sort    | O(n^2)                | O(1)          | Unstable | Complex   |
| Stack Sort        | O(nlog2(n))           | O(1)          | Unstable | Complex   |
| Merge Sort        | O(nlog2(n))           | O(n)          | Stable   | Complex   |
| Radix Sort        | O(d(n+r))             | O(r)          | Stable   | Complex   |
::: tip 
- **Stable Algorithm**: A sorting algorithm is stable if two objects with euqal keys appera in the same order in sorted output as they appear in input array to be sorted.
- **Complex Algorithm**: A complex algorithm is defined as an algorithm that embodies mathematical or logical methods and requires at least one thousand lines of the C programming language to implement.
